# Real-Time-News-Classification-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Traditional-Machine-Learning-Techniques <br>
üìå Overview<br>
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles in real-time into their respective categories using Logistic Regression and other traditional machine learning models. The goal is to automate the categorization process to help filter and organize digital news content effectively.<br>
üéØ Objectives<br>
*Automate classification of news articles into categories.
*Use traditional ML algorithms for accurate classification.
*Compare models based on multiple evaluation metrics.
*Simulate real-time news input and response.<br>
üîç Problem Statement<br>
In today‚Äôs digital age, the sheer volume of online news makes manual classification impractical. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning to categorize articles automatically based on their textual content.<br>
üß† Techniques Used<br>
Text Preprocessing<br>
Tokenization<br>
Stopword Removal<br>
Lemmatization<br>
Feature Extraction<br>
Bag of Words (BoW)<br>
TF-IDF Vectorization<br>
Machine Learning Algorithms<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Naive Bayes<br>
Support Vector Machine (SVM)<br>
Random Forest<br>
Evaluation<br>
Accuracy<br>
Precision, Recall, F1-score<br>
Confusion Matrix<br>
üìä Dataset<br>
Source: Kaggle Indexed News Dataset
Features: Fake news and Real news
Size: 25617 Articles<br>
üìà Model Evaluation Results<br>
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-score
Logistic Regression	0.9531	0.9464	0.9581	0.9522
Naive Bayes	0.8719	0.9819	0.7510	0.8511
