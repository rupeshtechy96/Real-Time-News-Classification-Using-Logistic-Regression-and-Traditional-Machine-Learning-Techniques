# Real-Time-News-Classification-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Traditional-Machine-Learning-Techniques
üìå Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles in real-time into their respective categories using Logistic Regression and other traditional machine learning models. The goal is to automate the categorization process to help filter and organize digital news content effectively.
üéØ Objectives
*Automate classification of news articles into categories.
*Use traditional ML algorithms for accurate classification.
*Compare models based on multiple evaluation metrics.
*Simulate real-time news input and response.
üîç Problem Statement
In today‚Äôs digital age, the sheer volume of online news makes manual classification impractical. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning to categorize articles automatically based on their textual content.
